### A Method for Comparative Analysis of Trusted Execution Environments

The problem of secure remote computation has become a serious concern of
hardware manufacturers and software developers alike. Trusted Execution
Environments (TEEs) are a solution to the problem of secure remote computation
in applications ranging from “chip and pin” financial transactions to
intellectual property protection in modern gaming systems. While extensive
literature has been published about many of these technologies, there exists no
current model for comparing TEEs. This thesis provides hardware architects and
designers with a set of tools for comparing TEEs. I do so by examining several
properties of a TEE and comparing their implementations in several technologies.
I found that several features can be detailed out into multiple sub-feature
sets, which can be used in comparisons. The intent is that choosing between
different technologies can be done in a rigorous way, taking into account the
current features available to TEEs.
