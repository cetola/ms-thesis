\caption[Recoverability Comparison]{\textbf{The possible recoverability features and the dependencies of those features.} Note that all these features will be firmware dependent. For Intel SGX, the features are supported as part of the Intel SDK provided to customers. Arm TrustZone has a reference implementation of the firmware required in Arm Trusted Firmware (see: \url{https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/tf-a/}). RISC-V only has partial recoverability and can be found in the Keystone Project here: \url{https://keystone-enclave.org/}. TEE Technologies are colored in \colorbox{tbl-gre}{green} while properties of the TEE are colored in \colorbox{tbl-yel}{yellow}.}
