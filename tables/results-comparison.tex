\caption[TEE Features and their dependencies]{\textbf{Several optional TEE features and the dependencies of those features.} Optional features of a TEE can be provided by the technology itself, by the chip manufacturer, by the platform vendor, or by the firmware. In turn, the firmware can be provided to the end user or can be custom. TEE Technologies are colored in \colorbox{tbl-gre}{green} while properties of the TEE are colored in \colorbox{tbl-yel}{yellow}.}

\caption[Recoverability Comparison]{\textbf{The possible recoverability features and the dependencies of those features.} Note that all these features will be firmware dependent. For Intel SGX, the features are supported as part of the Intel SDK provided to customers. Arm TrustZone has a reference implementation of the firmware required in Arm Trusted Firmware (see: \url{https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/tf-a/}). RISC-V only has partial recoverability and can be found in the Keystone Project here: \url{https://keystone-enclave.org/}. TEE Technologies are colored in \colorbox{tbl-gre}{green} while properties of the TEE are colored in \colorbox{tbl-yel}{yellow}.}
