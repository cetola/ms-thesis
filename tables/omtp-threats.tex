Group 1 & Hardware modules used for accessing memories, only including attacks mounted via modules built into the ``mobile equipment'' design (e.g. \gls{dma} module) \\ \hline
Group 2 & Colour LCD controllers or ``graphics chip of the mobile device'' designed to be pointed at memory blocks and could dump that information to the screen\\ \hline
Group 3 & Removal of battery or external memory card \\ \hline
Group 4 & Replacement of flash when power is off \\ \hline
Group 5 & Extract secrets by bus monitoring (e.g. hardware probes) \\ \hline
Group 6 & Attached devices (mod chips) used to attack data between flash and the \gls{soc} or in external RAM. \\ \hline
Group 7 & Replacement of flash when power is on \\ \hline
