\section{A Brief History of TEEs}
\glspl{tee} were first defined by the \gls{omtp} and ratified in 2009 \cite{Confidential2009} specifically for ``Handset manufacturers''. The \gls{omtp} standard was transferred to the Wholesale Applications Community (WAC) in 2010 and in July 2012 WAC itself was closed, with the \gls{omtp} standards being transferred to The GSM Association (originally Groupe Sp√©cial Mobile)\cite{WAC}. In this paper we will discuss the two most prevalent implementations of this standard for the x86-64 and AArch64 architectures, as well as a completely open source hardware and software implementation of a TEE for the RISC-V architecture.

We're going to talk about \gls{ime}, \gls{sgx}, \gls{soc}, \gls{smm}, \gls{aes}, \gls{vtx}, \gls{spmp}, \gls{epmp}, \gls{iopmp}, and \gls{pmp}.

 We're going to cover how each of these technologies contributed to \gls{tee} development, how they effect their use, why they lead to the development of \glspl{tee}, and how they fall short of providing the security of a \gls{tee}. Moreover, we should cover the fact that attacks have already been seen in \glspl{tee}, and that mitigating those attacks is required.
