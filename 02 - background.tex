\section{A Brief History of TEEs}
\glspl{tee} were first defined by the Open Mobile Terminal Platform and ratified in 2009 \cite{Confidential2009}. The OMTP standard was transferred to the Wholesale Applications Community (WAC) in 2010 and in July 2012 WAC itself was closed, with the OMTP standards being transferred to The GSM Association (originally Groupe Sp√©cial Mobile)\cite{WAC}. In this paper we will discuss the two most prevalent implementations of this standard for the x86-64 and AArch64 architectures, as well as a completely open source hardware and software implementation of a TEE for the RISC-V architecture.
