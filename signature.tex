% Original version by Joseph Pallas, Stanford University back in 1989

% Modified 11/14/06 by Josef Lotz
%    This was originally a Stanford style document and was modified
%    to suit the purposes of NEAR-Lab M.S. students at Portland State
%    University. I make no promises of absolute correctness so please
%    verify your results. A lot of unused functionality was stripped out
%    and code was changed to Portland State University formatting.
%
%    There is a lot of functionality that does not apply to PSU or the
%    ECE dept that I am leaving in, because I'm scared of breaking something! :-)
%    If you make changes date and comment. Thanks to Reto Toengi, Jorge Quinas
%    Brian Orlowski for their help in modifying/testing this file. They were
%    gracious enough to pass what they learned on to us!
