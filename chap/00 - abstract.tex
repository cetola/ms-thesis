The problem of secure remote computation has become a serious concern of hardware manufacturers and software developers alike. \glspl{tee} are a solution to the problem of secure remote computation in applications ranging from ``chip and pin'' financial transactions \cite{679731} to intellectual property protection in modern gaming systems \cite{da2018securing}. While extensive literature has been published about many of these technologies, there exists no current model for comparing \glspl{tee}. This thesis provides hardware architects and designers with a set of tools for comparing \glspl{tee}. I do so by examining several properties of a TEE and comparing their implementations in several technologies. I found that several features can be detailed out into multiple sub-feature sets, which can be used in comparisons. The intent is that choosing between different technologies can be done in a rigorous way, taking into account the current features available to \glspl{tee}.
