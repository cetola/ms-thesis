    name={root of trust},
    description={``A computing engine, code, and possibly data, all co-located on the same platform which provides security services. No ancestor entity is able to provide trustworthy attestation for the initial code and data state of the Root of Trust'' \cite{GlobalPlatform2018}. For system security purposes one might say, ``the buck stops here''}

    name={chain of trust},
    description={A series of entities that engage in secure transactions in order to provide a service. The first entity in the chain is referred to as the root of trust, while the last entity in the chain is often the end user or application requiring a secure transaction}
