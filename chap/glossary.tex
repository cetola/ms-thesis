{
        name=attestation,
        description={The process of assuring the validity and security of a system. The system can only be valid and secure if the code and data stored on the system have not been altered in any way that either causes the system to operate outside specifications or compromises the trust model}

        name=measurement,
        description={A cryptographic hash of data or code that will be loaded into memory. If this hash represents a piece of software, we can consider this hash the software's ``identity'' \cite{beekman2016improving} for purposes of attestation}

    name={root of trust},
    description={``A computing engine, code, and possibly data, all co-located on the same platform which provides security services. No ancestor entity is able to provide trustworthy attestation for the initial code and data state of the Root of Trust'' \cite{GlobalPlatform2018}. For system security purposes one might say, ``the buck stops here''}

\newglossaryentry{chain of trust}{
    name={chain of trust},
    description={A series of entities that engage in secure transactions in order to provide a service. The first entity in the chain is referred to as the root of trust, while the last entity in the chain is often the end user or application requiring a secure transaction}

    name={operational},
    description={A semantic of logic which formalizes the definition of a concept by generating a golden output model. Any system meeting the definition must produce the same output as that defined in the model}
